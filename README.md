# Club Penguin Imagined Archive
This is an archive of every\* custom file Club Penguin Imagined ever used.

*Some files have been removed as they are not mine to share. Our modifications to snowflake are also being kept at this time.

## Database backups
I am releasing two database backups. One, `latest.sql` is the database as of about 5 minutes after shutdown. `normal.sql` is the database one week prior, immediately before I unlocked the catalogues, so this version is preferable if you want to continue to experience the game without "cheated" items like mascot playercards and the like.

**All personal information has been removed from the database backups, and all of my copies have been destroyed as is required by law.**
This includes:
* Password hashes
* Emails
* IP hashes

The only identifiable information that remains are your usernames.

## Absolutely no support will be provided
I am releasing these files with the intent to archive them. I will not, nor will any Club Penguin Imagined staff, will not provide support with anything you may find in this archive. Poke around and figure out how things work, that's what I did.

## *That being said...*
If you wish to use these files and set up your own local version of Club Penguin Imagined, I recommend following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rerEJgwG4Q) to start with.
* From there, use the files in `default things/hadnlers/uploadable` to replace the vanilla versions.
* Then, locate and replace the relevant files with their versions in `default things`.
* Finally, choose your version of the database, explained above.

If you wish to recover your old account, head to [this website](https://toolbox.solero.me/houdini-hash-gen/) and type in your new password. Then, open up the database, find your username, and paste the hash it spits out into the password column.

**In keeping with the above section, this is the extent of instruction you will receive. Do not pester any staff for further assistance.**

## IMPORTANT: Use of these files
You are free to download and mess around with these files to your heart's content. You may use them freely on a locally-hosted server, however I **expressly forbid the use of any of these files or parts thereof on any public server\***. I will know.

*Public server is defined as any CPPS that can be accessed by more than one household.

If you wish to use anything you find in this archive publicly, you **must contact me\* and receive my permission *before* doing so**. You must also credit CPI, which I define as "if anyone asks, don't say you made it." That's all.

*Me as in Jeff The Rock. No other Club Penguin Imagined staff will give you permission.

My Discord username is `jefftherock`. Please feel free to reach out at any time for this reason.
## Most of all...
Please continue to enjoy the 3ish years of my life that I poured into this game. Despite the semi-scary wording I have to use to protect my work, I appreciate you all immensely. Thank you for your unending support over the years, and Waddle On. ðŸ’™
