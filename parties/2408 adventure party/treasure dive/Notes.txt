- This uses a custom gameStartParam: hasBrownPuffle. It's currently set to true in the HostEmulator.
- This exists because the AS3 minigame environment can't check if a specific puffle is being walked; it can only check if the player that puffle.

- There's some extra stuff here that diving doesn't use cuz I designed this to be a framework for future AS3 games.

- Messing with the XML values doesn't require recompiling the SWFs. This'll save some time.

Before shipping:
- Set debugMode to false in the config file. (Make empty)
- Set ALLOW_LOCAL to false in SecurityHandler.

TODO:
- Puffle graphics
- The sub and puffle just have some placeholder graphics cuz I'm not an animator.
- Can use the puffle's setState method if you want to change his expression based on whether he's attacking, idle, etc.

- More penguin animations maybe
- There's just the neutral one.

- Mess with sfx
- Some of em could be better.
- Choose background music. I just put Puffle Rescue as placeholder.
