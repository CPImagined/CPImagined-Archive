                    <h1>Why can't I play Club Penguin Imagined?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Club Penguin Imagined has closed to make way for our new experience, Club Penguin Zero, launching this October!<br><br>
                        
                        Club Penguin Imagined was first created all the way back in 2021 by someone who left almost immediately after, and never truly worked on the game.
                        I (Jeff The Rock) picked it up from there. Unfortunately, due to my inexperience as a developer at this time, what I created was fairly lackluster,
                        and as such resulted in very few people discovering the game. The first year of a server is very important for growth and stability, and that first
                        year of CPI was unfortunately botched for us.<br><br>

                        Club Penguin Zero is meant to be our own vision for Club Penguin, taking what we learned from Club Penguin Imagined to create what we see as a definitive
                        Club Penguin replacement. With years of research, community trust, and a solid foundation for what we can do, we want to create a longstanding place for
                        the community to truly thrive, without the fear of losing it all.

                    <h1>What is Club Penguin Zero?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Next year is the 20th anniversary of Club Penguin, and we want to make a big splash. Zero may be releasing in October 2025, but it'll feel like you're
                        all the way back in 2005. In the beginning, you'll see an alternative take on Club Penguin's opening, reintroducing old faces, old places, and old spaces
                        in new ways, as well as all the best pieces of every part of Club Penguin's history.<br><br>

                        You won't see everything right at the very start, but rest assured that everything you know and love about Club Penguin will be there, and quickly. We don't
                        want to waste time hyping up Card-Jitsu — nearly 20 years old itself at this point — and other things everyone's seen a million times. Instead, we want to cut
                        to the chase and get to the new stuff. However, these parts of the world still need to be properly introduced, so you can be sure that we'll do it all in new
                        and exciting ways!

                        Unfortunately, they won't follow you as you journey into Zero's new dimension, but don't worry! Your data has been saved, and if you'd like to, you can host your
                        own version of Club Penguin Imagined on your very computer! Keep an eye on our <a href="https://discord.gg/g5k5jh3M8J">Discord</a> for more information!<br><br>

                        As for why you can't bring over all your hard-earned coins and items to Club Penguin Zero, one of the biggest complaints we've received is, as Club Penguin Imagined
                        is over 3 years old now, people joining for the first time have missed so much. With Zero, we'll have a clean slate and everyone will be back to square one. Another
                        reason is simply because Zero is a completely separate entity, with a different style, different ideas, and different goals. Bringing over all of the existing stuff
                        would simply conflict too much with what we want to achieve. On top of this, we also want to increase security for Zero, such as with proper email system for support and account management, something that is nearly impossible
                        to change with over 21,000 registered accounts.
