                Hello everyone! Surprised to hear from me again? I wanted to address and quell your concerns about Imagined's future and our next step for Zero. There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding and confusion, especially with our recent growth, about why Imagined will be closing in March for a new take on Club Penguin with Zero.
              </p>
              <hr class="hrBlue" width="85%" noshade="true">
              <p>
                For starters, let's talk about why Imagined is closing. For this, we need a bit of a history lesson on this game. Club Penguin Imagined was created way back in 2021, by someone who is not Jeff or I. However, they dropped it after a very short time. Jeff then picked it up, and for a solid year Imagined got no traction, due to Jeff learning how to develop for Club Penguin, and it really stifled our growth. The first year of a server is considered incredibly important and it was unfortunately botched for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had joined the team in December of 2022 and from there Jeff and I, alongside our ever increasing staff team, built Imagined into what you knew it today. But we know we can do better, and we also want to address some things that help benefit you, the player. So let's talk about that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zero is meant to be our own vision of Club Penguin, taking what we learned from Imagined and making what we see as a definitive Club Penguin replacement, with years of research and community trust, we want to build something longstanding for the community at large, so that there is a safe and secure place for everyone, without the fear of it being temporary.
              </p>
              <hr class="hrBlue" width="85%" noshade="true">
              <p>
                Let's give a little more insight as to what Zero is:
              </p>
              <p>
                Next year is the 20th anniversary of Club Penguin, and we want to make a big splash. Zero will release in October 2025 but it'll feel like you're all the way back in 2005. You'll be seeing an alternative take on the beginning of Club Penguin, reintroducing old faces in a new way, and taking liberties of the best parts of all eras of Club Penguin in a new way. You might not expect to have everything in the beginning, but we will not have you wait long for everything you come to like about Club Penguin to be back, as we would rather focus on bringing all new things to the world, than hyping up Card-Jitsu for the 20th time, however those things still need to be reintroduced so they will be done in all new and exciting ways.
              </p>
              <hr class="hrBlue" width="85%" noshade="true">
              <p>
                Penguins have also asked about accounts and transferring over from Imagined to Zero, and the answer to that is No*, but before you get your pitchforks out, let me explain why.
              </p>
              <p>
                For starters, one of the big complaints people have had when joining Imagined was that because the game is approaching 3 years old, they're already missing so much. With Zero, everything will go back to basics and everyone will have a fair and equal opportunity to start fresh, together.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of this, we want to increase security for Zero, and having a proper email system for support as well as other enhancements can be done if we start fresh.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did put an asterisk though, so I will say there will be more information about how once Imagined closes, you can sign up to pre-register your name as the launch of Zero inches closer, so please stay tuned to our Discord for more information on that when the time comes.
              </p>
              <hr class="hrBlue" width="85%" noshade="true">
              <p>
                Finally, let's talk about what's next for Imagined. As I mentioned, the story is wrapping up, and the climatic finale is ever approaching. Will we finally get the answers to some of the biggest mysteries, such as what's Herbert hiding, what is the "Data Archive", why are maroon Puffles the way they are, and why the HECK did Darwin shoot out of the sky last December? All of that will be answered and more in the coming months, so please look forward to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of content, we are beginning to release things that will be recycled for Zero, such as minigame reskins for Halloween, (and Christmas) and still hard at work at the mobile app, so please look forward to all that. Imagined will live on through Zero, and we're hoping you'll take that journey with us and that you'll be excited as we are.
              </p>
              <hr class="hrBlue" width="85%" noshade="true">
              <p>
                Whew, I know that was a super long read, but I wanted to be as clear and assuring as possible that we are not going anywhere despite Imagined's fate. We encourage and invite you to not be discouraged by Imagined closing because we want you to see our exciting ideas we are putting in that will carry over to Zero, and give feedback as to what we're doing to make that perfect Club Penguin game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Okay, I think that's everything. If you made it to the end, use the code "CLUBPENGUINZERO" as a thank you for reading. It will never expire, so share it and use it as a talking point about the exciting things coming to the future!
              </p>
              <p>
                Waddle on!
              </p>
