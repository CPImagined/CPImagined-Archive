                Hello all,<br><br>

                It pains me greatly to say this yet again, but unfortunately the keys to the Mansion are <i>still</i> lost. If you'll 
                allow me a moment to whine, I can explain what exactly led to this point.
            </p>
            <hr class="hrPurple" noshade="true">
            <p>
                I have not had the best month.<br><br>

                I believe it mostly comes down to seasonal depression, but motivation has been at an all-time low for me, as well as the amount of real-life stuff that 
                leaves me unable to get things done here being unusually high this month as well. Those two things combined meant I did a lot of procrastinating. 
                And that is not something I can afford to let happen, given there is nobody else to take up my workload. That's how I end up writing a blog post 
                like this at 1 in the morning.<br><br>

                To be absolutely transparent, because of this, 90% of what came out on October 26th (or the 27th) was made day-of, excluding 
                the minigame reskins, as those were one of the few things that were not my responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                I attempt to present myself as if I have things worked out and am not working until the last second every single time, but in reality that's often 
                what happens with everything that I release. Generally, this isn't a big deal, but it has now gotten to the point of a 48 hour delay,
                which has never happened before, at least as blatantly as this, and as much as I like to joke otherwise, I hate lying to the fans.<br><br>

                Due to multiple unforeseen technical issues, things outside of my control, as well as hours seeming to just evaporate, I have not 
                yet completed the programming required for all the features of the Mansion. I'm still trying my best to get everything finished, 
                but I still feel as if I've failed for making you all wait so long regardless.<br><br>

                This is why I want to at the very least take a few minutes to keep you all up-to-date, and make sure you're all aware that it was my
                poor planning <s>and deciding to have a life</s> and mine alone that's caused this.<br><br>

                The party will be extended by a few days once the Mansion does actually release, and I hope that day is tomorrow.
            </p>

                Deeply sorry, and thank you all for your patience,
