                Hello Club Penguin Imagined!<br><br>
  
                Remember me? If you do, thank you, if you don't, it's nice to meet you! And if you are just meeting me now for the first time, I'm sorry it was so short-lived!<br><br>
  
                For you see my friends, today is an important day for me. On July 7, 2024, I will be taking a step back from Club Penguin Imagined permanently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, before you get your tissues out, don't worry, I chose my words very carefully. This is not a goodbye, but rather a see you later, for you see, 
                I will be wrapping up a few things behind the scenes, and generally speaking be much less involved with the current project and rather, after wrapping up a few more things, 
                dedicating all energy into new ventures and energy for Club Penguin towards our new project, which I am genuinely so thrilled to show you all once it's ready next year. 
                It's still awhile away, but believe me, I'm counting down the days, right until zero, and you should too! It's gonna be great. If you loved what we did here at Imagined, 
                you're gonna love what we're doing over there even more.
              </p>

              <p>
                But why am I doing this? Can't I dedicate time to both?<br><br>
                The short answer is, Yes! In fact, I have been for several months, and that's where the problem has arose. I'm only as much of a penguin as 
                you all are, and even the most active of us (I'm looking at you, Rookie) still need to pace ourselves. For the past 2 years it's genuinely been my greatest honor and highest 
                achievement to serve all of you, and that's exactly why I'm making this move, so I can continue to do so, better than ever before. I hope to what I've delivered all of you 
                is as close as you can get to magic, but even magic is only as special as it is because it's not the everyday and that's what I'm working towards balancing. I've made a lot of 
                sacrifices but also like everyone else, a lot of mistakes, (again, looking at you, Rookie...) and so taking this step back will allow me to really lock in and make sure I can 
                think more clearly and make those decisions that are better for everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, for full transparency, this also means unfortunately I will not be as present and if I am, not as personal as I once was, and ensuring I do a better job setting boundaries 
                for myself, for the team, and for everyone.<br><br>
                
                As much as Club Penguin is a place to waddle around and make those new friends, and I consider you all as such, it's not as easy of a 
                task to ensure I'm doing what I can do to be that good friend to all of you in the way that matches all of your individual needs. With Imagined right now, there's about 7000 of 
                you, and if our next project takes off, there could be a lot more zeroes after that so it's super important I and the rest of the team, better prepare ourselves for that coming up.
              </p>

                Now you know I couldn't go out without a bang. To celebrate all we've done together, I'm hosting my one and only Sora Sunday (I didn't want to take away from Spike's Saturday ;)) 
                on July 7 at 4:00 PM EST, or 1:00 PM PST. There will be some fun one day only surprises, lots of laughs, and maybe a surprise from me at the end of it. I hope to see you there, 
                but if you can't make it, I hope I can see you around the island when I do make my more slightly irregular visits and public appearances. 
              </p>

                Alright, I think that's everything!<br><br>
  
                Thank you so much for the read, take care, and until next time Waddle On!
