Cap'n Patch, lost on Shipwreck Isle,
with no way out to be found!
When the pirate crabs arrived,
then, trouble was bound!

Oh!

There they sat plan-
ning, thinking, drafting, devising!
But with every new plot and scheme,
More evil they would seem.

Oh!

Cap'n Patch and his pirate crabs,
Out to sail once more!
Plotting against Rockhopper,
Yarr, and the Migrator!

Hey!

There the Cap'n sat atop,
a thousand shipwrecks galore!
When out to sea there he saw,
the Migrator!

Oh!

Cap'n Patch and his pirate crabs,
Knew the time was right!
So they snuck aboard the Migrator,
in the dead of night!

Hey!

Left, behind!
Rockhopper watched them go,
before building a boat,
and beginning to row.
Hoping!
To see the island he called home!
Rise above the horizon once more!

Cap'n Patch and his pirate crabs,
home at last once more!
With Rockhopper right behind, still paddling his oar!

Hey!

There he would find his old mate Patch,
with crabs ever so bad!
But with a few words they would find,
they were a match!
Hey!
Rockhopper and Patch!
Hey!
Friends once more at last!



Fair winds, Fair winds!
The pirates say before they sail away!
Cause if you don't, you'll lose your boat
like ol' Patch did that day!

Ol' Patch was a sailor
True and blue, he never had bad luck!
Until he forgot the ye ol' phrase
and that made him wound up stuck.

Ohh, Cap'n Patch set off one day
The winds smelt of gold!
Ol' Patch thought he'd never be lost
until he retired of old!
Hey!

But Patch forgot the pirate code
Before he set his sails
He never wished the lands goodbye
The winds he'd learn he failed.

Ohh, Cap'n Patch set off one day
The winds smelt of gold!
Ol' Patch thought he'd never be lost
that poor Patch's soul.
Hey! 

Patch shipwrecked
Lost to the sea
Lost on an island
Forgotten by you and me!
Fair winds, fair winds
they say tell ye to say
Heeeey!

Ohh, Cap'n Patch set off one day
The winds smelt of gold!
Ol' Patch thought he'd never be lost
that poor Patch's story never told.

Ohh, Cap'n Patch set off one day
The winds smelt of gold!
Ol' Patch thought he'd never be lost
that poor Patch's fear was tenfold.

So remember the curse
Remember the code
Say Fair Winds Before you go
Say Fair Winds Before you go...
