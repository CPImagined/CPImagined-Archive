Anyway, you're in the cave and he's asking "How long have I been on this island... at least a week."

"Oh I am miserable here... the bitter cold annoys me to no end."

"But at least there is one thing I can have to myself, my new crustacean friend."

Klutzy: Click Click?

Herbert: Peace. Quiet. It's all I could ever ask for.

Herbert: For once in my life, something's gone rig-

and then you just hear a vuvuzela

"Huh? What was that?"

You can walk out to the wilderness and see random crap on the floor, like flags on trees rallying for a different team or whatever else

"What's going on? Klutzy! Did you put these here?"

Klutzy: Click.

Herbert: Grrr... take these lousy decorations down! Whoever decides to ruin my one moment of solitude will have to answer to ME!

Anyway you click on Klutzy and he'll take down the flagged trees before you see an open path

The mission ends with a cutscene as you see his POV shake around and get confused, seeing penguins celebrating at the Ice Rink the 2006 Sports Party

"WHY!? WHY IS THERE ALWAYS SOMETHING IN MY WAY?"

"THEY'LL LEARN. THEY'LL ALL LEARN...

it then cuts to a pan out of his feet as it slowly rises up and shows Herbert turn to look at the camera

NOBODY MESSES WITH HERBERT P. BEAR."
