                Hello everyone, and happy anniversary!<br><br>

                As you can probably see, there's been a bit of an upgrade around here. If you had eyes, you probably noticed that the old site sucked.
                It was clunky, it looked bad, and it was held together by Rory's best duct tape and a fishdog.<br><br>

                Now, it's held together by Rory's best duct tape, and <strong>TWO</strong> fishdogs! This additional fishdog has added mobile-friendly design, 
                meaning you can now actually see the website if you happen to load it up on your phone. This will also help Google and other search engines place
                us better, hopefully meaning more people will see this.
            </p>

                On top of that, a brand-new version of the client has been released!<br><br>

                It now includes proper Discord Rich Presence support, allowing you to display where you are in-game if you so choose!
                (You can also turn it off, for our more privacy-minded penguins, of course.) Also: Mac & Linux support! Finally, you Mac users 
                no longer have to struggle with the ridiculousness of the old client and the Unarchiver. There's also a lot of under-the-hood 
                upgrades, given it's a complete rewrite. You can find it on our new <a href="/download">download</a> page!

                In case it's not clear from the amount of exclamation marks I've used throughout this post, I am incredibly excited to finally 
                launch this, after nearly 5 months in the works. If you find any bugs, please do report them on our 
                <a href="https://discord.gg/g5k5jh3M8J">Discord</a> so I can get that sorted.<br><br>

                Thank you, and Waddle On!
