I simply grabbed a block that runs the Shazam shortcut when Magnifier opens. \nThis works, but whilst detecting the song I'd be greeted with a magnified view of the scene infront of me. I returned to the Shortcuts app to see what I could do, and to my surprise, and excitement, there's a scripting feature to exit to the homescreen. \nNow, I can trigger any Shortcuts functionality I want, triple-clicking the side button, and for only a second or two will the Magnifier app show up. \nPretty cool, huh?\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n    <img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"/media/accessibility-shortcut-magnifier.png\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n    <img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"/media/shortcut-when-app-opened-magnifier.png\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n    <img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"/media/inside-song-detection-automation.png\">\n</div>\n</div>","published":true}
