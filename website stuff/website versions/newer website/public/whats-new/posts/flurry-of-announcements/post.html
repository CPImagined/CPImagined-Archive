              Hey there penguins!
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope you've enjoyed the Prehistoric Party as much as we have! Especially because we're extending it until Feb 16th! This should give you a bit more time to find those rarer dino eggs and stomping around as a dinosaur.
            </p>
            <p>
              While that's being extended, what isn't is the wait for the next set of catalogs! You can expect an entirely brand new set of catalogs for both Penguin Style and Furniture & Igloo on Feburary 6th, with even some brand new items!
              This should get you all ready for the upcoming operation, as well as the Puffle Party, both happening this month!
            </p>

              Let's skip past all that though, because it's time for an exciting announcement.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you may know, we've been hard at work trying to release Card-Jitsu Snow for you all to enjoy again, and there's been a big question of "Will there be a party for it?" Well, the answer is yes and no.
            </p>
            <p>
              We didn't want to have a Card-Jitsu party focusing on something you've all might've experienced before, we'd rather save that for a new Card-Jitsu expansion. Instead, we'd like to introduce the return of the Festival of Snow!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a celebration where your art can be turned into Snow Sculptures and showcased across the island! To participate, submit your artwork submissions over on our <u><a class="awhite" href="https://discord.gg/g5k5jh3M8J">Discord</a></u>, in the <u><a class="awhite" href="https://discord.com/channels/896207399814311946/1203888303439478784">#festival-of-snow</a></u> channel!
            </p>
            <hr class="hrblue" width="85%" noshade="true">
            <p>
              For general guidelines, please keep the art limited to Club Penguin, and by extension Club Penguin Imagined, and nothing you wouldn't see outside of these places.<br>Don't worry, just as we are not rushing to finish Card-Jitsu Snow, you don't have to rush to finish your artwork. However, to ensure we don't leave you hanging, we're asking you all have submissions sent by <strong>Friday, March 8th</strong>.
            </p>
            <hr class="hrblue" width="85%" noshade="true">
            <p>
              We can't wait to see all you have in store, and we hope you're just as excited for all we have in store too!<br>
              Hope to see you all soon; Waddle On!
            </p>
