              Hello everyone and happy holidays!<br><br>
              This blog post is dedicated to all of you and your continued passion for Club Penguin Imagined this past year. As we come to a close to one chapter, another begins. But this beginning... Is the start of the end.<br><br>
              We are now approaching the final chapter of Club Penguin Imagined. 2024 will be the last full year of the game, and sometime early 2025 we will be wrapping things up with our big finale. We want to make sure this is something special, so we are planning this next year to be full of surprises, and we can't wait to share more with you soon.<br><br>
            </p>

              All I can tell you is this. The next Club Penguin Imagined Live Event is approaching. Log in on January 6th, 2024 at 2:00 PM EST for a taste of what's to come next in "Blast from the Past."<br><br>
              For now though, you can enjoy our newly released Holiday Party! This is a brand new party this year with a few new surprises, especially from our Advent Calendar so please log in each day to take a look at what's in store for you! We hope you like it.<br><br>
            </p>

              Last but not least, we'd like to thank you all so much for 4,000 registered users! Wow! One year ago we had less than 1,000 and now we've essentially tripled that! Incredible! To celebrate, enjoy this new limited time code, 4000WADDLERS for the exclusive Snowcone Launcher, which expires on January 7th!<br><br>
              Thank you all so much again, and we hope you continue to stick around and surprise us, just as we hope to do back for all of you! Waddle on!
            </p>
