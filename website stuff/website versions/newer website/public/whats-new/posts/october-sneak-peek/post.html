              Hey penguins!<br>
              Welcome to the month of October, and let me tell you, what a busy month it's already been!<br>
              I hope you've been enjoying the Sky Tours and revamping Tour Guides! That Tour Center is pretty cool, huh?
            </p>
            <hr class="hrblue" width="85%" noshade="true">
            <p>
              You know what else is cool?<br><br>

              Parties.<br><br>
              And this month we have not one but two! This month will be Club Penguin's 18th anniversary party, and let me tell you there are some BIG things in store. Not only that, but the Walt Disney Company (who we are not affiliated with but have immense respect and admiration for making Club Penguin what it was) is also simultaneously celebrating 100 years, and will have its own little shout-out for the party.
            </p>
            <hr class="hrblue" width="85%" noshade="true">
            <p>
              For now though, I'll leave you with this sneak peek of just a taste of what you can expect at this Anniversary Party.

              Man, what a classic party that one was huh? Well guess what! It doesn't stop there! This Halloween will consist of all new decorations for the main rooms, giving them a bit of that old look from years past. I hope you'll enjoy this nice change of pace for this party and find things to forward to about it. And don't worry, just because we are taking an older style doesn't mean we won't have the modern traditions! (Ghost Puffles anyone?)<br>
              I hope everyone will find something to look forward to this month and stay tuned for some more big announcements soon.<br><br>
              Waddle on!
