              Y'know, a question we've often get asked a lot is... "What's next?" and as much as we'd like to answer that, I first want to go over the question of "What's happened?"<br>
              There's been a lot of cool new changes happening to the game these past weeks. We finished up our Superhero Showdown Party (Thank goodness!) and Protobot decided enough was enough and started throwing meteors at us. Too bad we haven't really had a chance to panic yet because we've been so busy looking at our snazzy new map!
            </p>

              Hopefully this helps players old and new have something a little nicer to look at, as well as helping find some of our exclusive features a bit easier, from Blue Puffles being able to join you in Hydro Hopper, to the ever popular Puffle Berry's Best catalog in the Mall.

              Back to Protobot though, he's of course raining hellfire right now and while that does indeed make the job of our weatherman exciting for once (after reporting nothing but the cold for several years.) the EPF insists that there's nothing to worry about, and they have whatever they're planning over at the Snow Forts... Man, those guys are never gonna have enough time to rebuild the PSA HQ, huh? Regardless, I'm sure we'll hear more about that in the <i>future</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, enough beating around the bush, that's Sam's job anyway. Here's some sneak peeks for what's to come soon in the Imagined pipeline. We hope this excites you as much as it does us, and we thank you for continuing to waddle on with us!
