      Rockhopper: who is he? Well, he is Club Penguin Imagined's resident pirate, and usually comes around every 2-4 months.
      He also brings special rare items from other islands he finds in his travels around the seven seas!
    </p>
  <p>
    We managed to catch up to him before he left after the Holiday Party back in 2021 for an exclusive interview:

    Rockhopper: Ahoy! How be ye, matey?
    <br><br>
    Rumour Reporter: I'm doing great! Could I get an interview?
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: Of course matey! What do ye want to know?
    <br><br>
    Rumour Reporter: First, where do you go when you leave Club Penguin Imagined?
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: Well that be an easy one, matey! I always go to Rockhopper Island to stock up on me' supplies and things, then I head off into new adventures!
    <br><br>
    Rumour Reporter: What do you mean, "new adventures"?
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: I go where no pirate has gone before!
    <br><br>
    Rumour Reporter: Oh, really? I would've thought after nearly 17 years would would've explored the entire world by now!
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: Ye would think that wouldn't ye... 'twas hard to leave Club Penguin, then Club Penguin Island after that... I be happy that the penguins still be partyin' o'er there... even though all o' us "mascots" had to leave...
    <br><br>
    Rumor Reporter: Uh, Rockhopper? Are you ok?
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: What? Oh, yeah matey, of course I be alright! Just got lost in some memories...
    <br><br>
    Rumor Reporter: Ah, anyway, do you think you could tell us one of your famous stories?
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: Of course matey! Let's do one o' me favourites!<br>
    There be a memory dear to me heart,<br>
    It be the time I meet me best friend Yarr!<br>
    I was sailin' me ship the Migrator for new lands.<br>
    I be havin' all kinds of adventures.<br>
    Avast! In the sea there be a strange sight.<br>
    It be a piece of driftwood with a puffle atop it!<br>
    Of course, they weren't called puffles yet, the penguins over in Club Penguin hadn't even found one yet!<br>
    I hoisted the sails and sped to save that puffle's life!<br>
    Ay, he warmed to me like a clam to a shell<br>
    We be best buds and now he be me first mate!
    <br><br>
    Rumor Reporter: Bravo! I always love reading about that in your journal in the Book Room.
    <br><br>
    Rockhopper: Well matey, I think it be time for me to go! I be needin' to pack up the holiday decorations on the Migrator and get 'em stowed away, fair winds!
    <br><br>
    Rumor Reporter: Thanks for the interview Rockhopper, I'll see you next time!
  </p>

    What an interesting interview! That's all for today, goodbye!<br>
